# Capstone_2

Capstone_2 clean, analyze, and visualize business-related data using Python and its data analysis libraries.

Your growing business is developing a marketing list, but the application you use to collect
customer info generates that list in an awkward format, and the data contains some odd errors
and missing values. You need to develop a Python program to take that list as an input, separate it
into columns and rows, and clean up bad data, then output the results to a .CSV file.
You also now have a set of 2024 transaction data to help you understand how your business is
performing. You need to create an analysis of this data that reveals some information or insights
about your business.
